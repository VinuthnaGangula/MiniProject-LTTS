## Requirements
## Introduction
 We often come across serious discussions, debates and emotional flow of thoughts within ourselves. We know that there’s an inner voice talking and replying to us but we have never imagined it to be a separate entity of existence. It's our soul or the inner-self talking to us. Did you ever imagine it to have a physical form? How amazing would it be to have a life long companion by your side?
 
 A trilogy of fantasy novels, called **His Dark Materials**, by **Philip Pullman**, describes the existence of Daemons in a world similar to ours. A Daemon can be considered as a person’s soul in an animal form, which could be anything from a rabbit to a butterfly, to a dolphin. They play the role of mental companions and mental constructs, often created from our internal dialogue. It is certainly far from reality, but do you know it can help you to be self-aware?

#### Scope

The objective of this project is to introduce a fantasy concept and treat it to be a person's soul, as an initiative to bring awareness about one's inner-self.

#### State of Art

- The Daemon is a type of fictional being in the *Philip Pullman* fantasy triology *His Dark Materials* published in the year 2000. Daemons are the external physical manifestation of a person's "inner-self" that takes the form of an animal.
- Created in 2003, The Daemon Page was the first website dedicated completely to the philosophy of daemons. May seem weird to have a page for a fantasy being and you can call it fun but deepdown, its one way of finding yourself.

#### SWOT Analysis
- **Strength** : 
    1. Availabity of online resources.
    2. Similar quiz implementations availability.
- **Weakness** :
    1. Study of diverse species.
    2. Not easy or even impossible to conclude a person's character.
- **Opportunity** :
    1. Understand various phases of SDLC.
    2. Lot of room for growth.
- **Threat** :
    1. Issues with working equipment.
