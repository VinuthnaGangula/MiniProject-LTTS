Introduction:
Hello there! This is just a simple quiz game to help find your Daemon, or which I describe it to be a life long companion. 
There are so many kinds of species and their sub-species. Which is why it takes time and patience to find yourself, as a Daemon. 
This is purely a fun quiz. To find out your real Daemon, you should put time to understand your own self and start analysing and comparing, which eventually leads to finding your Daemon.
I hope you have fun!
